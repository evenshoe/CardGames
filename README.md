# CardGames
This code is a simple implementation of two popular card games, TwentyOne and War, in Java. The code consists of two classes, PlayingCards and Card. The PlayingCards class contains the main method and the logic for the game menu, while the Card class defines the properties of a playing card.

The PlayingCards class creates a list of cards containing all 52 cards in a standard deck. The game menu is displayed to the user, allowing them to select one of the two games or quit. If TwentyOne is selected, a new game of TwentyOne is created and the player is prompted to draw or stop until they either reach 21 or go over. If War is selected, a new game of War is created and the player plays against the computer until one of them runs out of cards.

To run the code, compile and run the PlayingCards.java file. The user will be prompted to select one of the games or quit. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the selected game.
